            <h2>A School for Colombo</h2>
            <p>Project Type: Studio Project/ Competition (Editor's Choice Award)</p>
            <p>Location: Colombo, Sri Lanka</p>
            <p>Partners: Brandon Raettig</p>
            <p>The school presented here has been designed for a competition in Sri-Lanka that called for an educational
                facility that centered community engagement. Before we started designing, we set up a group of
                principals that guided us throughout the design process.</p>
            <p>We wanted to mainly create a resilient structure that can potentially protect the inhabitants from the
                common flooding that occurs in the area. We also wanted to create a sense of ownership for the community
                it celebrates, where we not only give back the space to the community, but we also give them the freedom
                of deciding what happens next.</p>
            <p>Our school focuses on minimalizing dependence on public resources by harvesting solar energy, utilizing
                rainwater, and growing the bamboo that would be used as construction material on site. Our school is a
                landmark, both in form and in function, where the tower provides a visual marker for the surrounding
                community to signal the shelter. As well as act as the “well” or a place where people come to meet and
                gather.</p>
            <p>The school is meant to be an incomplete building that offers the infra structure and the raw materials to
                the community so they can decide what happens next as their needs change over time. The sunken courtyard
                offers a lush green oasis in contrast to the tower and the floodwater both in form and quality.</p>

            <h2>Speculations on Water in Quito</h2>
            <p>Project Type: Studio Project</p>
            <p>Location: Quito, Ecuador</p>
            <p>Partners: Katharine Odom, Katharine Stowe</p>
            <p>For this project, we studied closely the water problem in Quito Ecuador and its social, environmental,
                and economic effects on life near the Amazon. The premise of the studio was to propose a concept that
                would be a public institution, as well as an infrastructure complex that aimed to solve some of the
                water problems in Quito.
            </p>
            <p>Our proposal focused on “Parc El Sena” in central Quito and proposed a new way of raising awareness of
                the problem at hand for the locals in the city. The Machangara river that crosses the park is in a very
                bad condition right now, so we proposed a new “fake river” that follows the natural path of the river
                and would have allowed inhabitants to interact with a cleaner water as they reflect on the conditions of
                the actual river down below. As the “fake river” weaves between the hills of the site it creates
                destinations along the way and in this case, it would have connected a natural history museum and a
                public swimming pool.
            </p>
            <p>
                A third portion of the project was dedicated to get visitors a third point of view to compare the
                conditions of the water on both levels below. At this observatory point sits a horse stable that acts as
                the overseer's tower.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Student's Housing (TUM)</h2>
            <p>Project Type: Studio Project</p>
            <p>Location: Munich, Germany</p>
            <p>Partners: Roberto Martinez</p>
            <p>The premise of the project was to come up with an experimental housing complex for the Technical
                University of Munich (TUM). Our proposal for this project was to present an Urban grid system that is
                modular and could be applied to any given site like a carpet/ tapestry, then respond to the topography
                and the boundaries of the specific site accordingly. A series of different anomalies cut through the
                site to address issues of density and livability in the project offering spaces like green spaces and
                trails, communal assembly plaza, co-working/ co- studying spaces, shelters etc.
            </p>
            <p>The housing project was designed to house 4000 students and 1000 residents of different backgrounds. The
                design of this complex brings together people from mixed-age groups, mixed-income groups, and creates
                mixed land use spaces. The goal behind these ideas was to bring a sense of community and connectedness
                to the site which in turn would help with the social well- being of the residents.
            </p>
            <p>
                This complex does not only focus on the social sustainability, but it also takes into consideration the
                environmental sustainability starting from the materials used in the buildings construction to the water
                purification systems that incorporate facilities like the living machine and depends on collecting
                rainwater from the entire site to other facilities for recycling, composting, and vertical farming etc.
            </p>
